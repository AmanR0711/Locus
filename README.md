# Locus

An app where users connect via locations.

(Made for CRUx Inductions Round 3 )

## Tasks:

1. [] Complete authentication (bonus points for Google Oauth)

2. [] Create a home screen that shows the feed of all the people that the user follows with a clean UI. It should handle all kinds of posts (e.g., posts without any content, posts with images, posts with images and text, etc.)

3. [] Add a search screen to search for and follow other users. Your search should also include searching for posts based on location. 

4. [] Add a map screen where the user can view the most visited places(visited by the userâ€™s friends). For example, if Marine Drive in Mumbai has been visited the most, it should have a 
bigger pinpoint marker than the others. You could also put the rankings as text above the pinpoint marker. Make it look aesthetically pleasing. 

5. [] Comprehensive profile screen with post history, followers, and following, similar to Instagram. The profile screen should also have a section where the user can see all the places he has been to in a set timespan. Selecting any of the locations on the map should create a pop with the post made with that location.
